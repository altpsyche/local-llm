"""NB4 (contracts C1 dispatch, C6 registry) — the `python -m bob` runtime package.

This is a *real importable package* exposing the agent runtime as an API, so NE's interactive
shell (later) can consume `run_agent_events` in-process rather than via subprocess. It also owns
the command dispatch (`bob.cli`) and the command registry (`bob.registry`).

`python -m bob` requires `scripts/` on sys.path (the `bob_*` modules are siblings of this package).
The shim (scripts/bob.ps1 dispatcher / the POSIX `bob`) sets PYTHONPATH=scripts; in-process callers
(tests via _common) put scripts/ on sys.path. We add it here too, defensively.
